# Rails Toy App

A toy demo application to show off some of the power of Rails.

The purpose is to get a high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using scaffold generators, which create a large amount of functionality automatically.

From [Michael Hartl's The Ruby on Rails Tutorial] (https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning).
